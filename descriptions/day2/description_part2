PUZZLE 002 (Part 2)

The Elf says they've stopped producing snow because they aren't getting any water! He isn't sure 
why the water stopped; however, he can show you how to get to the water source to check it out 
for yourself. It's just up ahead!

As you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game you played, what is the 
fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible? 

The power of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together. 
For each game, find the minimum set of cubes that must have been present. What is the sum of the 
power of these sets?
